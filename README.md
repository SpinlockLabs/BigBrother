# Big Brother
Big Brother is a fun project to take metrics from any source and place it
into a big database.

## Technologies
RabbitMQ - Message queue between clients and server
Apache Cassandra - Database storage

## Why?
Why not? I wanted to learn how to use Apache Cassandra. I also wanted to work
with some "big data".
